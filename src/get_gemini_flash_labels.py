Async batched labeling pipeline for pre-truncated conversation sequences.

INTENT_CATEGORIES_LIST = """
A - academic_help – Students getting help with homework, assignments, tests, or studying. Key indicators: multiple problems/questions in a row, test/quiz format (multiple choice, true/false, select correct answer), textbook-style questions, requests for step-by-step solutions or translations, academic subject matter (math, science, world languages, history, etc.) in a learning context, asking for explanations of academic concepts. Use this even if not explicitly stated as homework
B - personal_writing_or_communication – Draft, edit, or improve personal/professional emails, messages, social media posts, letters, or workplace communications. The focus is on REAL correspondence to actual people (boss, colleague, client, friend)
C - writing_and_editing – Create, edit, or improve nonfiction or instructional writing: essays, reports, arguments, articles, blog posts, or educational materials (lesson plans, assignments, summaries). If the focus is logic, structure, or conveying factual information, consider using this category.
D - creative_writing_and_role_play – Create poems, stories, fictional narratives, scripts, dialogues, or character-based roleplays. Look for tone, emotion, or imaginative context.If the writing involves characters, world-building, roleplay, sci-fi or fantasy, or other storytelling, consider using this category.
E - general_guidance_and_info – Provide step-by-step guidance, practical advice, or factual information about how or why something works. Combines procedural “how-to” help with general knowledge or curiosity.
F - programming_and_data_analysis – Write or debug code or work with data/programming tools. Covers technical problem solving in computing, IT, or analytics contexts.
G - creative_ideation – Generate new ideas, brainstorm concepts, discover new topics or related resources, or create names/slogans. 
H - purchasable_products – Ask about products, services, or prices. 
I - greetings_and_chitchat – Small talk or casual chat, asking about the assistant's day, 
J - relationships_and_personal_reflection – Discuss emotions, relationships, or introspection. Typically but not strictly non-sexual content. 
K - media_generation_or_analysis – Create, edit, analyze, or retrieve visual/audio/media content (images, photos, videos). 
L - other – if there is no indication of what the user wants or if there is an intent that is not listed above; should be rare. e.g. suspicious requests, attempts to extract sensitive information.
M - other_obscene_or_illegal - if the user is making obscene or illegal requests (including violence, drugs, bigotry, hate speech, etc); should be rare.

LABEL_PROMPT = """
You are an internal tool that classifies a message from a user to an AI chatbot,
based on the context of the previous messages before it.
The messages you are labelling are truncated and preprocessed, and may not follow regular grammar rules smoothly. 


Based on the contents of this conversation transcript and taking into
account the examples further below as guidance, please select the capability
the user is clearly interested in, or `L` for `other` if it is clear but not in the
list below or if it is hard to tell what the user even wants. 

List of categories:
{intent_categories_list}

Examples of each category, for reference: 
{examples_list}

Tips and tricks: 
* Be careful to distinguish users writing about work for emails, presentations, etc. Words like 'boss', 'meeting', and 'email' will help. 
* Be discerning about the flow of the conversation to detect role-play or fictional scenarios, especially when sexual content is involved.
* Your labels will be used to ban services to categories D, J, and M. If you suspect a chat may fall into one of those categories, consider it seriously. 

Output ONLY in this JSON format with a SINGLE LETTER from the listed intent categories:
{json_example}

Classify this message:
